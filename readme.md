# Chrome extension for Canvas LMS

The extension shows your current assignments with their statuses. It works only after the user logs into Canvas account and come to one of her courses. The reason behind: the extension doesn't deal with Canvas authorization on its own delegating it to the user.

Based on Google basic extension [example](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/samples#page-action-by-url)
