# Project: Identify user preferences

## User Stories

As a user, I want to see all scheduled assignments for the course I have in Canvas, so that I could be on time and would never forget to submit them.

As a user, I want to have a button on my chrome bar which would be active only when I'm on the right page in Canvas, so that I could press it and get the current assignments.

As a user, I want the assignments list to be ordered by time left to submit each of them so that I could prioritize them easily.

As a user, I want the list looking good so that my esthetic feelings wouldn't be hurt.
